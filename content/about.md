Hi! My name is
From February 2022 to September 2022, I am living in Europe :european_union: as a visiting researcher at [INESC-TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en)/[University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/up/en/WEB_BASE.GERA_PAGINA?p_pagina=home)! My current research goal is to build :wrench: more efficient online k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms under a sliding-window regimen. Let's see how that goes!
